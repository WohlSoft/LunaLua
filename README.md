LunaLua - LunaDLL with Lua is a free extension for SMBX game engine
This version is based on LunaDLL ver. 8 with Lua Support.

Quick Overview
-------

**Features:**
* Increasing of total performance
* Fixes of some bugs
 * npc-*.txt with decimal numbers will no more crash SMBX with "runtime error 13"
 * fixes a random crash caused by contacting of the mushrooms with a lava blocks
* OpenGL render support
* SMBX's audio engine has been replaced with the better and more flexible SDL2_mixer library which also gives to SMBX the internal support of a [lots of additional music formats](http://wohlsoft.ru/pgewiki/SDL2_mixer#Music_Formats)

Requirements to build LunaLua yourself
------
Visual Studio 2015 (msvc140 compiler) or Clang 14

Building LunaLua on Linux
------

The `CrossCompilation` folder is a modified version of https://github.com/Nemirtingas/clang-msvc-sdk.

### Setting up headers and libs
* Install Visual C++ build tools 2015 and Windows SDK v7.1A (either on Windows or on Wine)
* Copy all files and folders from `Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC/include/` to `CrossCompilation/msvc/include/`
* Copy all files and folders from `Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/Include/10.0.10240.0/ucrt/` to `CrossCompilation/winsdk/Include/v7.1A/ucrt/`
* Copy all files and folders from `Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.1A/Include/` to `CrossCompilation/winsdk/Include/v7.1A/um/`
* Copy all files from `Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC/lib/` to `CrossCompilation/msvc/lib/x86/`
* Copy all files from `Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/Lib/10.0.10240.0/ucrt/x86/` to `CrossCompilation/winsdk/Lib/v7.1A/ucrt/x86/`
* Copy all files from `Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.1A/Lib/` to `CrossCompilation/winsdk/Lib/v7.1A/um/x86/`

### Compiling the project
Just run `make` in the `CrossCompilation` folder

NB: If you're using clangd and only want to generate compile commands, run `make compile_commands.json` in the `CrossCompilation` folder.

Note for Qt Creator IDE
------
If you wish you edit code via Qt Creator, you still must have Visual Studio because MSVC compiler is required.
**How to setup building from Qt creator**
* Open project and configure it
* Go to the "Projects" tab
* Disable shadow build for both Debug and Release
* remove ALL items from "Building" and "Cenaring" sections
* Add into "Building" a special item with:
 ** Command "build.bat"
 ** Argument "Debug" for debug build and "Release" argument for release build
* Add into "Clearing" a special item with "clear.bat" command
* Try to build project. If you have "MSBuild" in another path, please modify build.bat to take working build!
